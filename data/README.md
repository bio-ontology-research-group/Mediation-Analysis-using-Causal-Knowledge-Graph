# The data used in the project
- **causal_graph.tsv**: The causal graph used for the CKG where diseases are represented by ICD-10 codes and drugs are represented by RxNorm identifiers. 
- **curated_drug_mappings.tsv**: The expert-curated mappings are available where the partially matched candidates are shown and the expert curation indicates the drug(s) that should be mapped to the RxNorm drug.
